program xc_example

! This example contains calls to f90 interface routines that are needed to "talk
! to" the xcfun library and demonstrates how to use them.

! We will compute the kernel for an unpolarized system using total density and
! the gradient components as the variables. These are linear in the density
! matrix, which helps the code using the results from xcfun.
