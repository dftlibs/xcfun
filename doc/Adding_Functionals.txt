Here's how to add new functions to XCFun. Let's assume
the functional is called "myfunctional".

1) Create a new .cpp file in src/functionals, myfunctional.cpp
   Put #include "functional.h" at the top.

2) Implement your functional as a function accepting a densvars
   object and returning the exchange correlation energy. The type 
   of the input and return parameters should be a template typename. 
   Example (Slater exchange):

   template<class num>
   static num slater(const densvars<num> &d) 
   { 
     return -3.0/4.0*pow(6/M_PI, 1.0/3.0)*
       (pow(d.a,4.0/3.0) + pow(d.b,4.0/3.0));
   }

   Look in functional.h for the quantities present in densvars. Use the
   variables that are most convenient for you. Look at existing
   functionals for more examples.

3) Create a function called SETUP_FUNCTIONAL (this is a macro and will
   be expanded to something appropriate). In this function you set up
   your functional and describe it to the user.  You should also
   provide test input and output for the functional.  There can be
   only one SETUP_FUNCTIONAL function in each cpp file, so you must
   create one file for each functional.  If several functionals share
   some functions or data you can make a header file and put the
   shared items there. This is done, for example, with the PW92
   correlation energy, which is used in many other functionals. You
   also need to give a short and a long description of the functional,
   as well as its type (LDA, GGA etc).
   Example (Slater):

   SETUP_FUNCTIONAL(functional &f)
   {
     f.describe("slaterx",XC_LDA,
                "Slater LDA exchange",
                "LDA Exchange functional\n"
                "P.A.M. Dirac, Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical "
                "Society, 26 (1930) 376.\n"
                "F. Bloch, Zeitschrift für Physik, 57 (1929) 545.\n\n"
                "Implemented by Ulf Ekstrom\n"
                "Test case from http://www.cse.scitech.ac.uk/ccg/dft/data_pt_x_lda.html\n");

     SET_LDA_ENERGY_FUNCTION(f,slater::energy);
     static const double d[] = 
       {0.39E+02, 0.38E+02};
     static const double ref[] =
       {-0.241948147838E+03, // energy
        -0.420747936684E+01, // gradient
        -0.417120618800E+01,
        -0.359613621097E-01, // hessian
        0,
        -0.365895279649E-01 };
     f.add_test(XC_VARS_AB,2,d,ref,1e-11);
   }

4) Run `make', and the new .cpp file should be compiled automatically.
   Your functional will now be available to the library.
