<h1>XCFun</h1>
<p>
XCFun is a library of DFT exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. It is
based on automatic differentiation and can therefore generate
arbitrary order derivatives of these functionals. For more information
see the website <a href="http://admol.org/xcfun">admol.org/xcfun</a>.
This documentation refers to the development version of the XCFun library,
make sure that you are up to date.
</p> 


<h2>Installation and linking</h2> Compile the library using one of the
included makefiles (for example <tt>Makefile.gcc</tt>). This will
generate a library file <tt>lib/libxcfun.a</tt> which can be
statically linked to your application. Include files listing all
available functionals will be generated during the compilation of
XCFun. These files are <tt>include/xcfun_autogen.h</tt> (for the C
interface), and <tt>fortran/xcfun_autogen.f90</tt> for the Fortran
module. C or C++ programs that uses XCFun should include the <tt>xcfun.h</tt> header file, while Fortran programs should use the <tt>xcfun</tt> module defined in <tt>fortran/xcfun_module.f90</tt>.

<p> See also <a href="#Compile Time Options">Compile Time Options</a> below. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2> 

<p>To use the library you should first create
one <tt>xc_functional</tt> object for each functional and each thread
you want to use. Each functional object can only be used by one thread
at a time. After creating these objects
using <tt>xc_new_functional()</tt> you should set them up by defining
the variables to differentiate with respect to, as well as the
parameters of the functional you want to use. After having done so you
can use <tt>xc_eval()</tt> to evaluate the exchange correlation energy
and its derivatives.</p>

<p>Example C program that evaluates BLYP to order 2 using alpha/beta variables:</p>
<p>
<kbd>
#include "xcfun.h"<br/>
<br/>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])<br/>
{<br/>
&nbsp; int derivative_order = 2;<br/>
&nbsp; int nr_points = 1;<br/>
&nbsp; double density[5] = {1,2,3,5,4}; /* na nb ga.ga gb.gb ga.gb */<br/>
&nbsp; double output[21]; /* We have 21 output numbers for derivatives up to order 2 */<br/>
&nbsp; xc_functional fun = xc_new_functional();<br/>
&nbsp; xc_set_mode(fun, XC_VARS_AB);<br/>
&nbsp; xc_set_param(fun, XC_LYPC, 1.0);<br/>
&nbsp; xc_set_param(fun, XC_BECKEX, 1.0);<br/>
&nbsp; xc_eval(fun, derivative_order, nr_points, density, output);<br/>
}
</kbd></p>
<p>
Please see the complete API documentation below
</p>


<h2>Input, output and units</h2> The library uses atomic units for all
input and output variables. 

<p>The XC energy density and derivatives can be
evaluated using local spin-up (&alpha;) and spin-down (&beta;)
quantities. In the most general case these are
<ul>
  <li> <i> n<sub>&alpha;</sub> </i> The spin-up electron number density.
  <li> <i> n<sub>&beta;</sub> </i> The spin-down density.
  <li> <i> &sigma;<sub>&alpha;&alpha;</sub> = &nabla;n<sub>&alpha;</sub>&middot;&nabla;n<sub>&alpha;</sub> </i> The square magnitude of the spin-up density gradient.
  <li> <i> &sigma;<sub>&alpha;&beta;</sub> = &nabla;n<sub>&alpha;</sub>&middot;&nabla;n<sub>&beta;</sub> </i> The dot product between the spin-up and spin-down gradient vectors.
  <li> <i> &sigma;<sub>&beta;&beta;</sub> = &nabla;n<sub>&beta;</sub>&middot;&nabla;n<sub>&beta;</sub> </i> The square magnitude of the spin-down density gradient.
  <li> <i> &tau;<sub>&alpha;</sub> = 1/2 &Sigma;<sub>i</sub> |&nabla;&psi;<sub>i&alpha;</sub>|<sup>2</sup></i> The spin-up Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density.
  <li> <i> &tau;<sub>&beta;</sub> </i> The spin-down Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density.
</ul>    
Alternatively you can use total density (<i>n = n<sub>&alpha;</sub> + n<sub>&beta;</sub></i>) and spin density (<i>s = n<sub>&alpha;</sub> - n<sub>&beta;</sub></i>) variables. These also have corresponding gradient and kinetic energy components. See <tt>xc_set_mode()</tt> below for more information.</p>

<p>
  The output is given in graded reverse lexicographical order. For example a spin-polarized second order GGA functional will give 21 output elements, starting with the XC energy density. Symbolically we may write this as a list starting with the energy 
  <i>E, </i>
followed by five gradient elements 
<i>
E<sub>&alpha;</sub> E<sub>&beta;</sub>
E<sub>&sigma;<sub>&alpha;&alpha;</sub></sub>
E<sub>&sigma;<sub>&alpha;&beta;</sub></sub>
E<sub>&sigma;<sub>&beta;&beta;</sub></sub>
</i> and 15 second derivatives
E<sub>&alpha;&alpha;</sub>
E<sub>&alpha;&beta;</sub>
E<sub>&alpha;&sigma;<sub>&alpha;&alpha;</sub></sub>
...
E<sub>&beta;&beta;</sub>
E<sub>&beta;&sigma;<sub>&alpha;&alpha;</sub></sub>
...
E<sub>&sigma;<sub>&beta;&beta;</sub>&sigma;<sub>&beta;&beta;</sub></sub>. See the function <tt>xc_derivative_index()</tt> for information about addressing these elements.
</p>

<h2>API</h2>

The library is written in C++, but can also be directly used in a C
project or Fortran project. The C interface is described
in <tt>include/xcfun.h</tt>, while the Fortran interface is described
in the module file <tt>fortran/xcfun_module.f90</tt>. This
documentation tries to describe both the C and Fortran API at the same
time, even though small differences may exist between the two
interfaces.

<h3>Setup and Testing</h3>

<h3><tt>const char *xcfun_splash()</tt></h3> Return a multi-line
string describing the library. Please print this string so that your
users find the right citation for the library. The Fortran version
is <tt>xcfun_splash(text)</tt>, and the message is put in the string
text.

<h3><tt>xcfun_version()</tt></h3>
Return a double precision version number of the library.

<h3><tt>xcfun_test()</tt></h3> Run all internal tests and return the
number of failed tests. 


<h3>Creating and destroying functional objects</h3>

<h3><tt>xc_new_functional()</tt></h3> Create a new functional
object. The C version returns an object of
type <tt>xc_functional</tt>. The Fortran version returns an
integer. The creation of this object may be rather slow; create an
object once for each calculation, not once for each grid point.

<h3><tt>xc_free_functional(functional)</tt></h3>
Release the memory associated with functional (previously allocated by <tt>xc_new_functional()</tt>). 

<h3>Defining a functional</h3>
<h3><tt>xc_set_mode(functional, mode)</tt></h3> Set <tt>functional</tt> to operate in <tt>mode</tt>, one of 
<ul>

<li> <tt>XC_VARS_A</tt> Full spin polarization using only alpha
quantities, in the
order <i>n<sub>&alpha;</sub></i>, <i>&sigma;<sub>&alpha;&alpha;</sub></i>, <i>&tau;<sub>&alpha;</sub></i>

<li> <tt>XC_VARS_N</tt> Completely unpolarized mode using only total density quantities. <i>n</i>, <i>&sigma;<sub>nn</sub></i>, <i>&tau;<sub>n</sub></i>
<li> <tt>XC_VARS_AB</tt> Using alpha and beta variables: <i>n<sub>&alpha;</sub></i>, <i>n<sub>&beta;</sub></i>, <i>&sigma;<sub>&alpha;&alpha;</sub></i>, <i>&sigma;<sub>&alpha;&beta;</sub></i>, <i>&sigma;<sub>&beta;&beta;</sub></i>, <i>&tau;<sub>&alpha;</sub></i>, <i>&tau;<sub>&beta;</sub></i>
<li> <tt>XC_VARS_NS</tt> Using total density/spin polarization variables: <i>n</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>&sigma;<sub>nn</sub></i>, <i>&sigma;<sub>ns</sub></i>, <i>&sigma;<sub>ss</sub></i>, <i>&tau;<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>&tau;<sub>s</sub></i>
</ul>
The mode and the type of functional (LDA, GGA, metaGGA) determines the
number of variables used by the functional.
<h3><tt>xc_set_param(functional, param, value)</tt></h3> 
<p>Set the
parameter <tt>param</tt> in <tt>functional</tt> to some double
precision <tt>value</tt>. <tt>Param</tt> is one of the named constants
listed in <tt>include/xcfun_autogen.h</tt>
(or <tt>fortran/xcfun_autogen.f90</tt>). The parameters can be the
weight of different functionals, or some other parameter in the
functional definition. Example of parameters are <tt>XC_VWN5C</tt>,
the amount of VWN5 LDA correlation, and <tt>XC_RANGESEP_MU</tt>, the
range separation constant &mu; used in range separated hybrid
functionals. You can iterate over all parameters by using the <tt>XC_NR_PARAMS</tt> constant. C parameters start at 0 and Fortran parameters start at 1.
</p>
<p> The functional weights default to 0, while other parameters default to some sensible value. The current value of a parameter can be checked with the double precision function</p>
<h3><tt>xc_get_param(functional, param)</tt></h3> which returns the
current value of <tt>param</tt>. Note that different functionals may
have different parameter values set.

<h3><tt>xc_name(param)</tt></h3> <p>Returns the name
of <tt>param</tt>. This name is the same as the symbolic constant used
in the programming interface, so the first three characters
(<tt>XC_</tt>) can be stripped off before printing the string to the
user. The Fortran version is <tt>xc_name(param, name)</tt>.</p>

<h3><tt>xc_short_description(param)</tt></h3> Return a single line
(without newline) describing <tt>param</tt>. This may be a null string
if the parameter was not described in the library. The Fortran version
puts the description in the second argument to this subroutine.

<h3><tt>xc_long_description(param)</tt></h3> Return a multi-line
string (if present) ending with a newline. This string describes the
functional or parameter in more detail, and should include references
for citation and further information. The Fortran version
puts the description in the second argument to this subroutine.

<h3>Evaluating a functional</h3>
Given a functional that has been set up using the functions above
we may evaluate this functional up to the highest order defined in
<tt>src/config.h</tt>. Increasing the maximum order increases the
compile time and size of the library, so it is important to keep this
limit rather low. The current limits of the library may be queried with
the function
<h3><tt>xc_max_order(functional)</tt></h3>
which returns the highest derivative order supported by the previously defined <tt>functional</tt>.

<h3><tt>xc_get_type(functional)</tt></h3>
Returns one of the integers
<ul>
  <li> <tt>XC_LDA</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>XC_GGA</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>XC_MGGA</tt> </li>
</ul> depending on the parameters set in the functional.

<h3><tt>xc_input_length(functional)</tt></h3>
Returns the length of the input array (i.e. the number of density variables. This depends on the type of functional and on the evaluation mode. Typical values are 2 (LDA with incomplete spin polarization) or 5 (GGA with incomplete spin polarization). 

<h3><tt>xc_output_length(functional, order)</tt></h3> Return the
number of output coefficients computed by <tt>xc_eval()</tt> if
functional is evaluate up to <tt>order</tt>. Note that all derivatives
up to <tt>order</tt> are calculated, not only those of the particular
order.

<h3><tt>xc_regularize_density(functional, density)</tt></h3> Modify
density in-place so that <tt>functional</tt> can be evaluated without
infinities or floating point errors. This mainly involves making sure
that the density is physical and nonzero. In cases where the
derivatives should be infinite they will instead be very large, but
otherwise the effect on the output should be minimal.

<h3>C <tt>xc_eval(functional, order, density,result)</tt></h3> 
<h3>C Vector version <tt>xc_eval_vec(functional, order, nr_points, density, density_pitch,
result, result_pitch)</tt></h3> 
<h3>Fortran <tt>xc_eval(functional, order, nr_points, densities, results)</tt></h3>
<p>
Evaluate the previously defined <tt>functional</tt>
at <tt>nr_points</tt> different points, with derivatives up
to <tt>order</tt>. The input array <tt>density</tt> contains <tt>nr_points*N</tt>
density values, where <tt>N</tt> is the value returned by 
<tt>xc_input_length()</tt>. Similarly for the output array <tt>result</tt>. The input
and output arrays have the values for each point packed together. The output values
are stored in graded lexicographical order. For an LDA functional with alpha/beta variables we would therefore have the order E E<sub>a</sub> E<sub>b</sub> E<sub>aa</sub> E<sub>ab</sub> E<sub>bb</sub> E<sub>aaa</sub> E<sub>aab</sub> E<sub>abb</sub> E<sub>bbb</sub> ...
</p>

<p>
  The C vector version accepts two 'pitch' arguments, which is the
  distance in memory between the first elements of each point in the
  input and output arrays.
</p>

<p>
The Fortran always works on an array of points, and automatically
determines the pitch values. Note that the input numbers for each
point must be consecutive in memory (<i>stride</i> must be one).
</p>

<h3><tt>xc_potential(functional, density, energy, potential)</tt></h3>
<p>
Compute the XC energy and potential (<tt>potential[0]</tt> is alpha and <tt>potential[1]</tt> is beta) at a single point. For LDA this is
simply <i>v<sup>&alpha;</sup><sub>xc</sub> = dE/dn<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> and for GGA the expression is
<i>v<sup>&alpha;</sup><sub>xc</sub> = dE/dn<sub>&alpha;</sub> - &nabla;&middot;dE/d&nabla;n<sub>&alpha;</sub></i>. The latter case thus needs the evaluation of the second derivatives of the functional.
In the case of GGA the values of the density laplacians should be given at the end of the <tt>density</tt> array,
giving at total of seven numbers in the XC_VARS_AB case (which is the only one supported at the moment).</p>

<p>
  This function has to be called one point at a time.
</p>

<p>
MetaGGA's are not supported at the moment, although this is in principle possible to implement for functionals
that depend on the density laplacian (but not on the kinetic energy density).
</p>


<h3><tt>xc_derivative_index(functional, derivative)</tt></h3> Given an
integer array of "exponents" this function returns the index into the
output array of xc_eval where the corresponding derivative is
located. Note that this position depends on the functional type and
mode. Alternatively you can, for low orders, use the predefined constants
of the form <tt>XC_D01000</tt> (which corresponds to the first derivative
with respect to the second variable, <i>for setups with five variables</i>). To use these
predefined constants you must therefore know the type of your functional
beforehand. For LDA in a two variable mode the corresponding constant would be 
<tt>XC_D01</tt>, but this is a <i>different</i> index from <tt>XC_D01000</tt>.

<h2>Compile Time Options</h2> 
The file <tt>src/config.h</tt> contains a number of compile time options. These are 
<ul>
  <li> <tt>XC_MAX_ORDER</tt> Define this to the highest order of
  derivatives that the library should support. Too high values make
  the library huge in size.
  <li> <tt>XC_NO_REGULARIZATION</tt> Define this to turn off
  regularization of the input densities in <tt>xc_eval()</tt>. If you
  use this option and feed the library unphysical densities it can and
  will stop or crash. Use mainly to investigate numerical behaviour
  near singular points.
  <li> <tt>XC_NO_SCHWARZ_REGULARIZATION</tt> Do not strictly enforce
  the Schwarz inequality for the gradient norms. This inequality can
  be violated without encountering any problems for most functionals,
  and it's suggested that this option is kept active (i.e. the
  regularization is turned off).
  <li> <tt>XCFUN_IN_DEVELOPMENT</tt> Enable code that is still "in
  development". This code is probably marked "in development" for a
  reason, and may contain bugs.
  <li> <tt>XCFUN_REF_PW92C</tt> Use the truncated valued from the
    reference implementation for some exact constants in the PW92C
    correlation functional. This can help getting an exact agreement
    with other implementations. Functionals that use PW92C (i.e. 
    PBEC) are also affected by this options.
</ul>
